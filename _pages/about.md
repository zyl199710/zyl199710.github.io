Hello everyone. My name is **Yilong Zang**. Welcome to my website.

I am now a remote research assistant at [Data Science and its Applications (DSA) Research Group](https://datasciapps.de) in [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](https://www.dfki.de/en/web). I am honored to be supervised by [Prof. Sebastian Vollmer](https://datasciapps.de/author/sebastian-vollmer/).

I got my master's degree from [National Engineering Research Center For Multimedia Software](http://multimedia.whu.edu.cn/index.php?lang=2) at [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) in Sep. 2023. During that time, I was supervised by Prof. [Ruimin Hu](http://multimedia.whu.edu.cn/index.php?a=show&catid=69&id=71&lang=2) and Prof. [Zheng Wang](https://wangzwhu.github.io/home/) (co-advisor). My master's research task is graph-based fraud detection. I mainly analyze the new problems and patterns of fraudsters in graph data, and then design a suitable GNN model to solve the above problems.

Now my research interests are Biomedical/Geographic graph data mining.

 My goal as a PhD is to become an independent researcher. I hope to delve into the theory of graph data and graph neural networks, such as robustness, efficiency, and acceleration.

During my spare time, I like to do a variety of sports, like swimming, fitness, and badminton. I've recently become addicted to snowboarding, and I've tried both single and double boarding.
