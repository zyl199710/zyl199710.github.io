Hello. I am **Yilong Zang (臧屹隆)**. Thank you for visiting!

I am now a research assistant as well as a prospective PhD student at [PolyU SHTM](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/shtm/). My supervisor is [Dr. Hengyun Neil Li](https://research.polyu.edu.hk/en/persons/hengyun-li). 

Now my research interest focus on **the application of GNNs and LLM to business survival prediction**, as well as some interesting and challenging hotel and tourism-related tasks.

Prior to that, I was honored to work as a research assistant in the [DSA](https://datasciapps.de) group at [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](https://www.dfki.de/en/web) for a period of time under the supervision of [Prof. Sebastian Vollmer](https://datasciapps.de/author/sebastian-vollmer/).

I got my master's degree from [National Engineering Research Center For Multimedia Software](http://multimedia.whu.edu.cn/index.php?lang=2) at [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) in Sep. 2023. During that time, I was supervised by Prof. [Ruimin Hu](http://multimedia.whu.edu.cn/index.php?a=show&catid=69&id=71&lang=2) and Prof. [Zheng Wang](https://wangzwhu.github.io/home/) (co-advisor). My master's research task is graph-based fraud detection. I mainly analyze the new problems and patterns of fraudsters in graph data, and then design a suitable GNN model to solve the above problems.


During my spare time, I like to do a variety of sports, like swimming, fitness, and badminton. I've become addicted to snowboarding, and I've tried both single and double-boarding.
